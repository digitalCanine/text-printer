A small terminal script that prints a user-defined phrase in brackets, flooding the screen line by line with smoothly shifting colors.

Automatically uses the terminal colors, if you want a full rainbow add the `-r` or `--rainbow` argument.

The provided text is always rendered in the form:

```bash
./printer.sh "DC"
./printer.sh "digitalCanine"
./printer.sh "github"
```

When no string is attached, the printer will default to printing DC

---

To exit the printer script, hit `ctrl+c`.
On exit, the terminal will print `The system stands, quietly`, however its always possible to change the script to make it print what you want.
